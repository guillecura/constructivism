###Installation

The theme works with Ghost 0.7.4 or newer. You also need to enable the [Public Beta API](http://support.ghost.org/public-api-beta/). This is a checkbox at the bottom of your blog's _Settings_ page. If you are using [Ghost.org's Pro](https://ghost.org/) platform, follow the instructions at the [Ghost support page](http://support.ghost.org/upload-theme-ghostpro/). If you are using a Ghost installation in your own server, follow these steps.

First download the latest release. If you are hosting your own Ghost installation, unzip the tarball file into `content/themes/`. After that you'll need to restart Node. Then login into your blog, go to _Settings_ and pick up **constructivism** from the Theme dropdown.

###How to use

#####Basic Setup

After installing the theme you'll need to create some basic content in order to make everything work correctly.

**Static pages and default Tags**

First things to do: create the posts you'd like to be static pages, for example: _about us_ or _contact us_. From the post settings turn those posts as "static pages".

![Static page example](http://guillecura.co/content/images/2016/03/Captura-de-pantalla-2016-03-01-a-las-5-56-37-p-m-.jpg)

You'll need two default tags to divide the case study posts and the articles: `portfolio` and `thoughts`. After you creating those two tags you can start to test the content.

**Publish Case Studies**

The idea using this theme is to write a post for every case study, so the only thing that separates a "portfolio" post from an article will be the tag. The main difference is that the portfolio will display the cover image and its title as the expert. If you want a nice case study post, you should add a post cover, and the `portfolio` tag. _Note: you can add as much tags as you want, just be sure the "portfolio" tag is the first one_.

**Publish Articles**

The articles or "thoughts" are aimed to show text instead of images, so the expert or preview will show only the title and description of each post. To set up a thought you'll need to add the `thought` tag at the beginning.

###Basics

You can display as much posts as you want in the home page by marking it as featured in the post settings panel.

Other thing is to create a nice navigation menu. By default you'll only have the home item. From the Navigation menu you can add the static pages you created and the "portfolio" and "thoughts" tags to that menu.
